# Merge Sort

Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm which sorts a list of elements by recursively dividing the list into two halves, sorting the two halves individually and then combining the sorted halves. 

## Time Complexity

* The algorithm converts each problem of size `n` into two subproblems of size `n/2`, sorts them, and then combines the sorted halves in linear time.
* The time complexity can be derived using the Master's theorem where a=2, b=2, and Î± = 1.
* Time complexity, `T(n) = nlog(n)`
